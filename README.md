# 🚀 LeetCode Solutions Auto-Synced with LeetCode Tracker

Welcome to my **LeetCode playground**! Every time I solve a LeetCode problem, my solution is instantly beamed up to this repo by the [LeetCode Tracker](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/leetcode-tracker/mojbjmadgddjbhokmpgnceiplpdkaodj) Chrome extension—no manual copy-pasting, no hassle, just pure coding automation magic.
